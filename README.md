Type@
=========================

A Javascript based tool that query a database for dropdown autocomplete once an "@" sign is found. 

### REQUIREMENT
Needs jQuery.

### VERSION
alpha

Once user typed '@', all alphanumeric, dashes and underscored are sent to the database to query a match.  If the spacebar is pressed, the query will stop.

### TODO
- Move away from relying on jQuery
- Instead of displaying the match from the server beneath the textarea, allow user to click and replace the @ string.
